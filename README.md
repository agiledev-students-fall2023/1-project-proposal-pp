### What and why?
Although resources for reviewing the knowledge test for auto driving licence is avaiable, there's no formatted web app that help people prepare the knowledge test that every applicant for driving licence in New Jersey will take. We would like to build a webapp that focuses on helping student driver in New Jersey to create their personalized test that reduces the error rate of certain part in the knowledge test and saves the time for learners because the materials avaible online are disorganized. It solves the problem of learning new knowledge and reviewing by providing instant message and individualized recommendations.
